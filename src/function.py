This Lambda function receives log entries from CloudWatch Logs or S3 buckets
and pushes them to New Relic Infrastructure - Cloud integrations.

It expects to be invoked based on CloudWatch Logs streams although it's
ready to read log files from S3 buckets too.

New Relic's license key must be encrypted using KMS following these
instructions:

1. After creating te Lambda based on the Blueprint, select it and open the Environment Variables
section.

2. Check the "Enable encryption helpers" and press "Encrypt" button next to the "LICENSE_KEY" 
environment variable.

3. Go to the start of the page and press "Save". Logs should start to be processed by the Lambda.
To check if everything is functioning properly you can check the Monitoring tab and CloudWatch Logs
